# Codename: Teabag

About five years ago in 2019, I was tasked at school to make a '**T**ext-**B**ased **A**dventure-**G**ame' (T-BAG).
You may have heard of such a thing before - a game where the player controls their character through simple typed commands such as **WALK**  or **FIGHT**.
Being myself five years ago, I wildly overcomplicated the task and planned multiple expansions which I never started making... though I did ace the test!

Starting my degree, I was surprised at just how many students, even in [STEM](https://www.britannica.com/topic/STEM-education) find computers and programming... mystical - like a monster you only poke with a long stick.
I found this quite sad: programming had been a major part of my life since my original **Codename: TeaBAG**.
Given that I'm not nearly as incompetent as I was in 2019, I think I now have something to offer:

*It's time to de-mystify programming.*

## ‚úîÔ∏è Requirements & FAQs

You don't need any special equipment to use this guide.
A computer or laptop with a functioning internet connection is required, but if you're reading this, you've probably got that sorted.

- ***Do I need to be able to touch-type?***
  - Nope. If you don't know what touch-typing is, that's fine - it doesn't matter anyway.
- ***Do I need a powerful computer?***
  - Nope. Everything we'll use here can be done on what I would call a potato-laptop.
- ***What do I do if I get ambushed by goblins?***
  - You can try negotiating, but most goblins aren't very talkative. In that case, I recommend a *Wand of Magic Missiles*.

## ü§î What, Why and How

### What is programming?
It seem like a silly question to ask in a programming tutorial, but it's work asking!

> To Program: Provide (a computer or other machine) with coded instructions for the automatic performance of a task. (Oxford Languages)

Or, in simpler terms, you tell a computer the steps it needs to do a task.

*That is it.*

However... just as if you were baking a cake, it isn't very helpful if the instructions are in Arabic, but you only speak French. Computers (yes, even ChatGPT under the hood) need humans to talk to them in specific ways.

### Why learn programming?

Maybe, like me, your job requires it.

Maybe, also like me, you take pleasure in just making things.

### How do I learn to program?
Think of another skill you'd like to learn: for me, it's woodwork.

To go and learn (for example) woodwork, I may do some reading, but I'd want to try making something! Perhaps a nice comfy chair...

The same goes for programming. You've got to try things out! Have some fun, make some mistakes and learn from them!

## üìã How to use this guide
First, go watch this YouTube Short by *Low Level Learning*. It'll only take a minute:

https://www.youtube.com/shorts/O99NMMk4I4g 

Right, did you watch it? Yes? Good.

This is not a generic tutorial, which is why I call it a guide instead.
I am going to arm you with the skills you need to "escape tutorial-hell".
In this *guide*, we will build a **T**ext-**B**ased **A**dventure **G**ame, just like I did back-in-the-day,
    but I'm also going to show you *how to think for yourself and get help*.

Throughout this *guide*, there will be sections where you have to look things up or use your initiative.
This may be challenging but I'll guid you through. ***Do not skip these sections.***

You *do* want to escape tutorial-hell... Right?
