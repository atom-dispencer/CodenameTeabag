You don't have to fear programming, and we're going to build a game to prove it.

To all my engineering buddies who 'hate programming', this guide is for you. üòâ

## ‚úîÔ∏è Requirements & FAQs

You don't need any special equipment to use this guide.
A computer or laptop with a functioning internet connection is required, but if you're reading 
    this, you've probably got that sorted.

- ***Do I need to be "smart"?***
  - Nope - I'll guide you through.
  Besides, you're smarter than you think. üòâ
- ***Do I need to be good at maths?***
  - Nope. 
  Maths and programming are different skills, but they share some traits, so learning one might 
  make you better at the other.
- ***Do I need a powerful computer?***
  - Nope. 
  Everything here can be done on an internet-enabled potato[^1].
- ***What do I do if I get ambushed by goblins?***
  - You can try negotiating, but most goblins aren't very talkative.
  In that case, I recommend a
  [*Wand of Magic Missiles*](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/4794-wand-of-magic-missiles).
- ***Do I need to be able to touch-type?***
  - Nope. 
  If you don't know what touch-typing is, that's fine - it doesn't matter anyway.
- ***Does my operating system matter?***
  - Not for what we're doing. 
  If you don't know what an operating system is,
  **a**) It doesn't matter anyway,
  **b**) You're probably on Microsoft Windows.

## üî• What is tutorial-hell?

Tutorial-hell is where you end up when you copy-paste without understanding what it is you're copying, so 
    you never learn or become independent.

Sound bad? Well it's even worse than you think, so watch this video:

    frameborder="0"
    allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share"
    allowfullscreen
></iframe>

*Did you watch it? I'll wait...*

An easy way to get to tutorial-hell is by not listening to people who try to help you escape ü§®... 
***Did you watch the Short??***

Speak after me: ***"I will not copy-paste in Codename: TEABAG"***...
It's your choice, but it won't help you.

You don't want to go to tutorial-hell... Do you?
