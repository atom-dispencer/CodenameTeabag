In school about five years ago (2019-ish), I was tasked with making a 
    '**T**ext-**B**ased **A**dventure-**G**ame' (T-BAG).
You may have heard of such a thing before - a game where the player controls their character 
    through simple typed commands such as **WALK**  or **FIGHT**.
Being myself five years ago, I wildly overcomplicated the task and planned multiple expansions
    which I never even started... though I did ace the test!

Starting my degree, I was surprised at just how many students, even in
    [STEM](https://www.britannica.com/topic/STEM-education) find computers and programming...
    mystical - like a monster you only poke with a long stick.
I find this quite sad: programming has been a major part of my life since my original **Codename: TeaBAG**.
Now that I'm not nearly as incompetent as I was in 2019, I think I have something to offer:

*Let's de-mystify programming.*

## ‚úîÔ∏è Requirements & FAQs

You don't need any special equipment to use this guide.
A computer or laptop with a functioning internet connection is required, but if you're reading 
    this, you've probably got that sorted.

- ***Do I need to be able to touch-type?***
  - Nope. 
  If you don't know what touch-typing is, that's fine - it doesn't matter anyway.
- ***Do I need a powerful computer?***
  - Nope. 
  Everything we'll do here can be done on an internet-enabled potato.
- ***What do I do if I get ambushed by goblins?***
  - You can try negotiating, but most goblins aren't very talkative.
  In that case, I recommend a
  [*Wand of Magic Missiles*](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/4794-wand-of-magic-missiles).
- ***Does my operating system matter?***
  - Not for what we're doing. 
  If you don't know what an operating system is,
  **a**) It doesn't matter anyway,
  **b**) You're probably on Microsoft Windows.

## ü§î What, Why and How

### What is programming?
It may seem like a silly question in a programming tutorial, but it's work asking!

> To Program: Provide (a computer or other machine) with coded instructions for the automatic performance of a task. (Oxford Languages)

Or, in simpler terms, you tell a computer the steps it needs to do a task.

*That's it... However...*

Just like baking a cake, it's not very helpful if you speak French but the instructions are in Arabic.
All computers need humans to talk to them in specific ways.

### Why learn programming?

Maybe, like me, your job requires it.

Maybe, also like me, you take pleasure in just making things.

### How do I learn to program?
Think of another skill you'd like to learn.
The piano, perhaps?

To learn an instrument, you'll do some reading and learn some theory, but it's nothing if you don't practise!

The same goes for programming!
Theory will only take you so far, so you've got to practise and experiement!
That's why this guide will get you doing some work, not just copying ;).
So try to make some mistakes, learn from them and (hopefully) enjoy the experience.

## üìã How to use this guide
First, take a minute to watch this YouTube Short:

<iframe
    width="315" height="560"
    src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/O99NMMk4I4g"
    title="YouTube video player"
    frameborder="0"
    allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share"
    allowfullscreen
></iframe>

*Did you watch it? I'll wait...*

Tutorial-hell is where you end up if all you do is blindly copy-paste from tutorials:
    you never learn or become independent.
A sure-fire way to get there is by not listening to people who try to help you ü§®... 
    ***Did you watch that Short??***

This is not a tutorial, it's a *guide* for avoiding or escaping tutorial-hell.
For that, you need skills which a standard *tutorial* won't teach you, namely how to
    think-through problems and find help when things go wrong...

Say this after me: ***"I will not copy and paste in Codename: TEABAG"***... Coz it ain't gonna help you.
If you copy-paste the answer, you won't learn: learning takes practise.

*Together* in this *guide*, we will build a **T**ext-**B**ased **A**dventure **G**ame, just like I did 
    back-in-the-day, but I'm also going to show you how to think for yourself and get help on your own.
Throughout, there will be sections where you have to look things up or use your initiative.
This may be challenging but I'll guide you through.
***Do not skip these sections.***

You *do* want to escape tutorial-hell... Right?
