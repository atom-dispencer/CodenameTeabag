Most programming tutorials are, for want of a better word, *crap*.
    *[Source: Just Google 'programming tutorial']*
Either they're way too advanced for beginners, or they start by attempting to justify their existence,
    show some mediocre code for you to copy-paste, then expect you do divine the purpose of it via s√©ance.

That's why this is not a tutorial.

## üìñ The story so far...

In school about five years ago (2019-ish), I was tasked with making a 
    '**T**ext-**B**ased **A**dventure-**G**ame' (T-BAG).
You may have heard of such a thing before - a game where the player controls their character 
    through simple typed commands such as **WALK**  or **FIGHT**.
Being myself five years ago, I wildly overcomplicated the task and planned multiple expansions
    which I never even started... though I did ace the test!

Starting my degree, I was surprised at just how many students, even in
    [STEM](https://www.britannica.com/topic/STEM-education) find computers and programming mystical - like 
    a monster you only poke with a long stick...
Five years down the line, I find this quite sad.
Programming has been a major part of my life since my original **Codename: TeaBAG**, so
    now that I'm not nearly as incompetent as I was in 2019, I think I have something to offer.

*Let's de-mystify programming.*

## ‚úîÔ∏è Requirements & FAQs

You don't need any special equipment to use this guide.
A computer or laptop with a functioning internet connection is required, but if you're reading 
    this, you've probably got that sorted.

- ***Do I need to be "smart"?***
  - Nope - I'll guide you through.
  Besides, you're smarter than you think üòâ.
- ***Do I need to be good at maths?***
  - Nope. 
  Maths and programming are different skills, but they share some traits, so learning one might 
  make you better at the other.
- ***Do I need a powerful computer?***
  - Nope. 
  Everything we'll do here can be done on an internet-enabled potato.
- ***What do I do if I get ambushed by goblins?***
  - You can try negotiating, but most goblins aren't very talkative.
  In that case, I recommend a
  [*Wand of Magic Missiles*](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/4794-wand-of-magic-missiles).
- ***Do I need to be able to touch-type?***
  - Nope. 
  If you don't know what touch-typing is, that's fine - it doesn't matter anyway.
- ***Does my operating system matter?***
  - Not for what we're doing. 
  If you don't know what an operating system is,
  **a**) It doesn't matter anyway,
  **b**) You're probably on Microsoft Windows.

## ü§î What, Why and How

### What is programming?
It may seem like a silly question in a programming tutorial, but it's work asking!

> To Program: Provide (a computer or other machine) with coded instructions for the automatic 
> performance of a task. (Oxford Languages)

Or, in simpler terms, you tell a computer the steps it needs to do some helpful task.
    
Computers are not smart - they're just very fast at executing simple instructions called "machine-code",
Machine-code just tells the computer where to move data from and to inside itself, and it's hard to 
    write because it's all binary, like so: `010101000100010101000001010000100100000101000111`.

If that makes any sense to you, you're definitely some kind of demigod and certainly don't need me.

If, on the other hand, you're a normal human being, a "programming language" may be helpful.
Programming languages give humans an easier way to instruct the computer in its task, and they come in
    all shapes and sizes.
Together, these instructions form a "program" which can be translated into the machine-code that the computer
    so desperately craves.


### Why learn programming?

Maybe you're learning because you need it for your education or job.
Perhaps you have some grand project you want to make - the game to end all games?
Some people just want to try it out. All of these are valid reasons to want to learn.

I learned because I wanted to 
    [modify the game *Minecraft*](https://github.com/atom-dispencer/MagiksMostEvile/tree/1.7.10/)
    (I warn you, my old code is dreadful) but I kept going because it lets me make whatever I want.
Given some time and commitment I can create games, helpful tools for myself, or even a [computer inside
    a computer](https://github.com/atom-dispencer/iAtomSys).


### How do I learn to program?
You learn to program the same as any other skill - the piano, perhaps?

To learn an instrument, you'll do some reading and learn some theory, but practise is key!
Any musician will tell you that "theory can only take you so far", which is why this guide will try to 
    make you sweat a bit... (***"I will not copy-paste... I will not copy-paste..."***).
If any mistakes come up (and I'll make sure they will üòâ), I encourage you to explore and find out 
    what went wrong so we can learn from and (hopefully) enjoy the experience.

## üìã How to use this guide
First, take a minute to watch this YouTube Short:

<iframe
    width="315" height="560"
    src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/O99NMMk4I4g"
    title="YouTube video player"
    frameborder="0"
    allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share"
    allowfullscreen
></iframe>

*Did you watch it? I'll wait...*

Tutorial-hell is where you end up if all you do is blindly copy-paste from tutorials:
    you never learn or become independent.
A sure-fire way to get there is by not listening to people who try to help you ü§®... 
    ***Did you watch that Short??***

This is not a tutorial, it's a *guide* for avoiding or escaping tutorial-hell.
For that, you need skills which a standard *tutorial* won't teach you, namely how to
    think-through problems and find help when things go wrong...

Say this after me: ***"I will not copy and paste in Codename: TEABAG"***... Coz it ain't gonna help you.
If you copy-paste the answer, you won't learn: learning takes practise.

*Together* in this *guide*, we will build a **T**ext-**B**ased **A**dventure **G**ame, just like I did 
    back-in-the-day, but I'm also going to show you how to think for yourself and get help on your own.
Throughout, there will be sections where you have to look things up or use your initiative.
This may be challenging but I'll guide you through.
***Do not skip these sections.***

You *do* want to escape tutorial-hell... Right?
