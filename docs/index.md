About five years ago in 2019, I was tasked at school to make a '**T**ext-**B**ased **A**dventure-**G**ame' (T-BAG).
You may have heard of such a thing before - a game where the player controls their character through simple typed commands such as **WALK**  or **FIGHT**.
Being myself five years ago, I wildly overcomplicated the task and planned multiple expansions which I never started making... though I did ace the test!

Starting my degree, I was surprised at just how many students, even in [STEM](https://www.britannica.com/topic/STEM-education) find computers and programming... mystical - like a monster you only poke with a long stick.
I found this quite sad: programming had been a major part of my life since my original **Codename: TeaBAG**.
Given that I'm not nearly as incompetent as I was in 2019, I think I now have something to offer:

*It's time to de-mystify programming.*

## ‚úîÔ∏è Requirements & FAQs

You don't need any special equipment to use this guide.
A computer or laptop with a functioning internet connection is required, but if you're reading this, you've probably got that sorted.

- ***Do I need to be able to touch-type?***
  - Nope. If you don't know what touch-typing is, that's fine - it doesn't matter anyway.
- ***Do I need a powerful computer?***
  - Nope. Everything we'll use here can be done on what I would call a potato-laptop.
- ***What do I do if I get ambushed by goblins?***
  - You can try negotiating, but most goblins aren't very talkative.
  In that case, I recommend a *Wand of Magic Missiles*.

## ü§î What, Why and How

### What is programming?
It may seem like a silly question in a programming tutorial, but it's work asking!

> To Program: Provide (a computer or other machine) with coded instructions for the automatic performance of a task. (Oxford Languages)

Or, in simpler terms, you tell a computer the steps it needs to do a task.

*That's it... However...*

Just like baking a cake, it's not very helpful if you speak French but the instructions are in Arabic.
All computers need humans to talk to them in specific ways.

### Why learn programming?

Maybe, like me, your job requires it.

Maybe, also like me, you take pleasure in just making things.

### How do I learn to program?
Think of another skill you'd like to learn.
The piano, perhaps?

To learn an instrument, you'll do some reading and learn some theory, but it's nothing if you don't practise!

The same goes for programming!
Theory will only take you so far, so you've got to practise and experiement!
That's why this guide will get you doing some work, not just copying ;).
So try to make some mistakes, learn from them and (hopefully) enjoy the experience.

## üìã How to use this guide
First, go watch this YouTube Short by *Low Level Learning*. It'll only take a minute:

[https://www.youtube.com/shorts/O99NMMk4I4g]()

*Right, did you watch it? Yes? Good.*

This is not a generic tutorial, which is why I call it a guide instead.
I am going to arm you with the skills you need to "escape tutorial-hell" - a state where you spend all
    your time copying from tutorials without truly learning
In tutorial-hell, you are unable to write anything original because the tutorials have not taught you to 
    do more than blindly copy.

**Copying is not learning. To learn, you must practise.**

*Together* in this *guide*, we will build a **T**ext-**B**ased **A**dventure **G**ame, just like I did 
    back-in-the-day, but I'm also going to show you how to think for yourself and get help on your own.
Throughout, there will be sections where you have to look things up or use your initiative.
This may be challenging but I'll guide you through.
***Do not skip these sections.***

You *do* want to escape tutorial-hell... Right?
