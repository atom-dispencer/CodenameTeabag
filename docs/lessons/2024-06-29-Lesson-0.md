# üîº Typing (Shift vs. Caps Lock)

Some people don't know that the *Caps Lock* and *Shift* keys on your keyboard do different things:

![Keyboard](caps-lock.png)
```
The 'Caps Lock' key TURNS CAPITALS ON UNTIL YOU press it again.
 Caps-Lock pressed ^             Pressed again ^


The 'Shift' key TURNS ON CApitals while you HOLD IT DOWN.
                ^--shift--^^---no shift---^^---shift---^
```

When programming, you'll do a lot of typing.
I highly recommend teaching yourself to use *Shift* because:
- You'll need to press it anyway because of symbols like `= + - _ % ^ &`
- Why would you want to spam *Caps Lock* twice?
```
Some people type Single Capital Letters using Caps Lock...
^                ^      ^       ^             ^    ^
  Press Caps Lock, then the letter, then Caps Lock again.


... but people who Type a Lot know that Shift Works Better.
                   ^      ^             ^     ^     ^
  Hold Shift while typing the letter.
```
There are probably two *Shift* keys on your keyboard (left and right).
Take a moment to find them - they're probably marked with *Shift* or an *upwards arrow*.

Don't use *Caps Lock*. 
Please just hold *Shift*...
Please.

# What is 'Syntax'
Like human languages, programming languages have rules which a programmer must follow for the computer to
    be able to 

In the same way, computers need the 'recipes' humans write to follow the rules of the programming
    language that is being used.
Think of it like baking a cake: 
a baker (programmer) writes a recipe (program) so that their friend (the computer) can bake a cake 
    (perform some useful task).
If the baker's friend is very [pedantic](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/pedantic) 
    (like a computer), they won't know how to follow the recipe if the baker makes a spelling error.
