# 🔼 Typing (Shift vs. Caps Lock)

Some people don't know that the *Caps Lock* and *Shift* keys on your keyboard do different things:

![Keyboard](caps-lock.png)
```
The 'Caps Lock' key TURNS CAPITALS ON UNTIL YOU press it again.
 Caps-Lock pressed ^             Pressed again ^


The 'Shift' key TURNS ON CApitals while you HOLD IT DOWN.
                ^--shift--^^---no shift---^^---shift---^
```

When programming, you'll do a lot of typing.
I highly recommend teaching yourself to use *Shift* because:
- You'll need to press it anyway because of symbols like `= + - _ % ^ &`
- Why would you want to spam *Caps Lock* twice?
```
Some people type Single Capital Letters using Caps Lock...
^                ^      ^       ^             ^    ^
  Press Caps Lock, then the letter, then Caps Lock again.


... but people who Type a Lot know that Shift Works Better.
                   ^      ^             ^     ^     ^
  Hold Shift while typing the letter.
```
There are probably two *Shift* keys on your keyboard (left and right).
Take a moment to find them - they're probably marked with *Shift* or an *upwards arrow*.

Don't use *Caps Lock*. 
Please just hold *Shift*...
Please.
